# 10.014 Computational Thinking for Design 1D Project (Fall 2020)
This game was created for 1D Project submission for 10.014 Computational Thinking for Design.



## Project Requirements Overview

> Write your own python-based computer game that, at the minimum, has a **text-based user interface**. In other words, 
> We shall define a computer game in this project as a python program created for the entertainment of at least one user. 
> This computer game can be based on an existing game, or it can be your own game. 

> There are the following restrictions to be followed by everyone without exception: Your game shall be written entirely in python. You may use only standard python libraries. i.e. user needs not do a `pip install` to play your game. Your game must have a text-based user interface, any other visual library used in this course e.g `turtle` or `matplotlib` can be on top of this. One exception to rule 2 is that you can use the external libraries that are introduced in this course, e.g. the `pyrebase` library
